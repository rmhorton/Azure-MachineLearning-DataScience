These are the files for the learning curve demo:

* `sim_data.R` functions to generate simulated data.
* `learning_curve_lib.R` functions for running learning curves.
* `run_learning_curve_demo` script to run simple demo on small dataframe. Commented lines show how to adapt for larger XDF files on HDFS.
